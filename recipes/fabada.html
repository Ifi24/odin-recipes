    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fabada asturiana, often simply known as fabada, is a rich Asturian bean stew, originally from and most commonly
        found in the autonomous community of Principality of Asturias, but widely available throughout the whole of
        Spain and in Spanish restaurants worldwide.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g of Asturian faba (beans)</li>
        <li>250 g of cured bacon</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>3 saffron strands</li>
        <li>200 g of ham bone</li>
        <li>2 <em>chorizos</em></li>
        <li>2 <em>morcillas</em></li>
        <li>Salt (to your taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We spread the beans on a flat surface and discard those that are damaged. We wash them to remove impurities.
        </li>
        <li>We leave them in a bowl with cold water to soak overnight, usually 12 hours. It is not necessary to add salt
            when soaking. The next day we drain them and set them aside until the moment of preparing them.</li>
        <li>Soak the cured bacon and the ham bone in lukewarm water from the night before preparing the fabada.</li>
        <li>We add the beans in a casserole, if possible low and wide (if it is clay better). We cover with water until
            there is a couple of fingers above them. Stir again so that everything comes together well. Heat over high
            heat until it starts to boil.</li>
        <li>When it starts to boil, add the bacon, the chorizos, the ham bone and the black pudding (previously pierced
            to prevent them from bursting).</li>
        <li>Make sure that the black pudding and chorizos always remain on top to avoid possible breakage that would
            spoil the fabada.</li>
        <li>We foam for a few minutes. That is to say, we remove the foam that normally contains impurities and at the
            same time we defat the broth a little. When it has been cooking for 1/2 hour over high heat, add the saffron
            threads diluted in a little hot broth from the casserole.</li>
        <li>We lower the cooking temperature. We add salt to taste, it is important to taste the broth since we have
            added the ham bone and they can be salty.</li>
        <li>We let them cook slowly at low temperature for 2 hours. Always stirring from time to time with a wooden
            spoon without breaking them. During these two hours, we add cold water twice to "scare" them (it breaks the
            boil and helps to cook them perfectly).</li>
        <li>We taste the fabada to see if they are already tender and we rectify the salt. Once tasted and tender,
            remove from the heat and let rest for about an hour.</li>
        <li>Next we remove the chorizos, the black pudding, the bacon and the ham bones. Prepare the meat, cutting the
            sausages into generous slices. Chop the bacon and take advantage of the meat from the bone. We reserved for
            the presentation. The best way to serve it is a deep plate with the fabada and the meat on top, it's that
            easy.</li>
    </ol>
